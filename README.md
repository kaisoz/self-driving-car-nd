# Self Driving Car Nanodegree

This repository contains the source code and write-ups of all the projects I've done in the **[Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/self-driving-car-engineer-nanodegree--nd013)**.

Enjoy! :-)

      <br>
           Detected highway lane lines on a video stream. Used OpencV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough Transforms and Canny edge detection.

      <br>
           Built and trained a deep neural network to classify traffic signs, using TensorFlow. Experimented with different network architectures. Performed image pre-processing and validation to guard against overfitting.

      <br>
           Built an advanced lane-finding algorithm using distortion correction, image rectification, color transforms, and gradient thresholding. Identified lane curvature and vehicle displacement. Overcame environmental challenges such as shadows and pavement changes.

      <br>
           Created a vehicle detection and tracking pipeline with OpenCV, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG), and support vector machines (SVM). Implemented the same pipeline using a deep network to perform detection. Optimized and evaluated the model on video data from a automotive camera taken during highway driving
